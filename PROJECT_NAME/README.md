This dapp is inspired by the idea of people from a closed community coming together to save, invest and borrow funds, also known as a form of rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA), around the world. Aegos addresses the issue that this community faces, which involves low trust in participants and low security of funds as well as fund management costs. With Aegos, there is no middleman involved and the smart contract itself is the fund manager. Here, every fund participant is to pledge crypto collateral of a value 120% greater than their individual fund value (duration * monthly amount), providing security from deposit defaulters. If there is a default in depositing, then all of the crypto collateral is sold, thus keeping the fund alive.
